/** Main - entry point class for this project
 1.'C' and Java have a main function/method that is the ENTRY into code execution. Both languages need a file to contain that ENTRY method/function.  Common convention for 'C': main.c.  Convention for Java: Main.java.
 2. split requires a "Main.java" file and a main class ("public Class Main").  Inside the class it expects a method named "public static void main(String[] args)"."
 3. Conventions and structures are part of a programming language and the tools you use.  Python people like to pick on these Java conventions, saying they are difficult.  What do you think?
